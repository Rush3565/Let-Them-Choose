This can lead to decreased motivation, poor academic performance, and long-term dissatisfaction. The pressure can also affect their mental health, causing feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. It is crucial for parents to recognize their child's unique talents and interests and provide support rather than impose rigid expectations. Encouraging open dialogue and allowing children to explore different options can foster a healthier and more positive educational experience. Parents should also seek to understand the evolving interests of their children and be flexible in their expectations to promote overall well-being.\"\n}, {\n  title: \"The Impact of Parental Pressure on Career Choices\",\n  summary: \"Explores how parental pressure affects children's career decisions and mental health.\",\n  details: \"Parental pressure to pursue certain careers can cause children to feel trapped and undervalued, leading to stress, anxiety, and even depression. This pressure often stems from parents' desires for security or social status but can overlook the child's passions and abilities. When children are forced into careers they do not enjoy, it can result in poor job satisfaction and burnout later in life.

Exploring compromise solutions, such as taking elective courses or pursuing hobbies alongside required studies, can help balance parental expectations with personal desires.

Addressing this issue requires raising awareness about children's rights, providing access to quality education, and offering community support to families facing economic hardships.
